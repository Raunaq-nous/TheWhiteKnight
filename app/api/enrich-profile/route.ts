CURRENT PROFILE SNAPSHOT:
- Skills on file: ${skillsList || "(none)"}
- Certifications on file: ${certNames || "(none)"}
- Experience: ${expSummary || "(none)"}
- Voice/preferences notes: ${voiceNotes || "(none)"}

TEXT TO SCAN:
---
${text.slice(0, 2000)}
---

Look for ONLY these categories:
1. SKILL — a specific tool, technology, language, or method the candidate mentions using or being proficient in, NOT already in the skills list
2. CERTIFICATION — a course, credential, or certification they completed, NOT already in the certifications list
3. ACHIEVEMENT — a quantified outcome or notable accomplishment from their own work (revenue, users, time saved, award), NOT already captured
4. VOICE_NOTE — a stated preference about communication style, work style, or job search constraint (e.g. "I prefer not to work in fintech", "I always open with data")

Rules:
- Return empty array if nothing new is found. Do not invent or stretch.
- Each suggestion must be genuinely new vs the profile above.
- Maximum 3 suggestions per scan.
- "value" should be the exact text to add, short and clean.
- "description" should be a 1-sentence explanation of what was detected and why it's worth adding.

Output JSON only:
{
  "suggestions": [
    { "type": "skill", "description": "Candidate mentioned using Pinecone, not in skills list.", "value": "Pinecone" },
    { "type": "voice_note", "description": "Candidate stated a preference for async-first teams.", "value": "Prefers async-first work environments." }
  ]
