- Latest role: ${latestRole}${latestCompany ? ` at ${latestCompany}` : ""}
- Location: ${location}
- Open to: ${openTo}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Tailor companies to this specific candidate. A brand designer should get design studios and creative agencies, not consulting firms. A CS student should get internships, not director roles. A consultant should get strategy firms and big tech.
2. ${regionHint}
3. Include a mix: 40% well-known tier-1 employers, 40% strong tier-2 (less competitive, equally good fit), 20% niche/emerging companies the candidate might not know.
4. For each company, infer the most likely careers URL (e.g. company.com/careers, careers.company.com).
5. Use realistic sector labels — examples: "consulting", "big-tech", "ai-emerging", "design-studio", "advertising", "edtech", "fintech", "biotech", "healthtech", "media", "creative-agency", "vc-pe", "saas", "ecommerce", "gaming", "non-profit", "research-lab".
6. Match seniorityFit to the candidate's profile: "junior" if <2yr experience or student, "mid" if 2-6yr, "senior" if 7-12yr, "leadership" if 13+yr or director-level headline.
